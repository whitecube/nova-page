Ever wanted to expose static content of an "About" page as editable fields in your app's administration without having to create specific models & migrations? Using this package, you'll be able to do so. By default, it will store the content in JSON files in the application's `resources/lang` directory, making them available for version control. A database source is also available.

This package adds basic **flat-file CMS features** to Laravel Nova in a breeze using template configurations as if it were administrable Laravel Models, meaning it allows the usage of all the available Laravel Nova fields and tools.

## Quick start

Here's a very condensed guide to get you started asap. For more details, examples and advanced features, take a look at [the full docs](https://whitecube.github.io/nova-page).

### Install

Laravel      | Nova       | nova-page
:-------------|:----------|:----------
\< 9.x        | < 4.0     | < 0.3.0
9.x           | 4.0       | ^ 0.3.0

```bash
composer require whitecube/nova-page
```

Then register the Nova tool in `app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php`:

```php
public function tools()
{
    return [
        \Whitecube\NovaPage\NovaPageTool::make(),
    ];
}
```

### Usage
In order to assign fields (and even cards!) to a page's edition form, we'll have to create a `Template` class and register this class on one or more routes. You'll see, it's quite easy.

#### Creating Templates

```bash
php artisan make:template About
````

```php
namespace App\Nova\Templates;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\Text;
use Whitecube\NovaPage\Pages\Template;

class About extends Template
{

    /**
     * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
     *
     * @param  \Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields(NovaRequest $request)
    {
        return [
            Text::make('Title of the page', 'title')
        ];
    }

    /**
     * Get the cards available for the request.
     *
     * @param  \Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function cards(NovaRequest $request)
    {
        return [];
    }
}
```

```php
Route::get('/about-me', 'AboutController@show')
    ->template(\App\Nova\Templates\About::class)
    ->name('about');
```

Fields and cards definition is exactly the same as regular [Laravel Nova Resources](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/1.0/resources/fields.html#defining-fields).

#### Loading the data in your pages
The easiest way is to use middleware.

In the `App\Http\Kernel` file:

```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        'loadNovaPage',
    ],
};

// ...

protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'loadNovaPage' => \Whitecube\NovaPage\Http\Middleware\LoadPageForCurrentRoute::class,
];
```


#### Accessing the data in your views

Retrieving the page's static values in your application's blade templates is possible with the `get` directive or using the `Page` facade.

```blade
<p>@get('title')</p>

// or

<p>{{ Page::get('title') }}</p>
```

Please note it is also possible to define [Option Templates](https://whitecube.github.io/nova-page/#/?id=option-templates) for repeated data, which can be accessed using:

```blade
<p>@option('footer.copyright')</p>

// or

<p>{{ Page::option('footer')->copyright }}</p>
```

If you are using a custom menu for example Nova::mainMenu(function (Request $request) {return [... menu secions and items... ]}
Just add: MenuItem::link(__('nova-pages'), '/resources/nova-page'),
          MenuItem::link(__('nova-options'), '/resources/nova-option')
